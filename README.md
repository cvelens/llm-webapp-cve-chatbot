# CVE Query System Frontend

## Overview

The CVE Query System Frontend is a web-based interface for querying and interacting with a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. It provides a chat-like interface similar to ChatGPT or Claude, allowing users to submit queries about CVEs and receive AI-generated responses.

## Features

- User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Chat-like interface for CVE queries
- Real-time updates of chat history
- Persistent storage of user queries and AI responses
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python 3.9+ with Flask framework
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Database: SQLite (via SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Authentication: Flask-Login
- API: RESTful design principles

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cve-query-frontend.git
   cd cve-query-frontend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

6. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5002` (or the appropriate address if you've configured it differently).

## Usage

1. Sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.
2. Once logged in, you'll see the main query interface.
3. Type your CVE-related query in the input field at the bottom of the page.
4. Press Enter or click the Send button to submit your query.
5. The AI-generated response will appear in the chat area above the input field.
6. Your query history will be displayed on the left side of the screen.

## Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying the following files:

- `app/__init__.py`: Database URI, secret key, and other Flask configurations
- `run.py`: Host and port settings for the development server

## Development

To contribute to this project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, concise commit messages
4. Push your changes to your fork
5. Create a pull request to the main repository

Please ensure that your code follows PEP 8 style guidelines and includes appropriate tests.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI instead of the Flask development server.
2. Set up a proper database system like PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.
3. Ensure all sensitive information (like the SECRET_KEY) is stored in environment variables.
4. Set up HTTPS using a valid SSL certificate.
5. Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve static files and proxy requests to the WSGI server.
